Lightbox support

If you want to add lightbox support you can set the super types on the `Picture` node type:

```
'Jonnitto.Picture:Picture':
  superTypes:
    'Jonnitto.Picture:Lightbox': true
    'Jonnitto.Picture:Caption': true
```

After that, you can install [Jonnitto.PhotoSwipe](https://github.com/jonnitto/Jonnitto.PhotoSwipe) via composer: `composer require jonnitto/photoswipe`  
Et voil√†: You've just included [PhotoSwipe](http://photoswipe.com/)
